This project focuses on building and demonstrating practical workflows using PySpark, the Python interface for Apache Spark. The primary goal is to empower data engineers and analysts to handle large-scale data processing by leveraging Spark’s distributed computing architecture alongside Python’s ease of use. Key focus areas include: setting up a Spark session programmatically, ingesting data from diverse sources, performing large-scale transformations and aggregations at scale, applying Spark SQL and DataFrame APIs for expressive querying, optimizing jobs for performance (e.g., partitioning, caching), and integrating with downstream workflows including ETL pipelines, machine-learning preprocessing or streaming ingestion. The codebase is structured to reflect best practices: modular components for configuration, data layer, transformations, and job orchestration. Emphasis is also placed on reproducibility (e.g., using parameter files or environment variables), logging and error-handling. By working through this repository, practitioners can deepen their understanding of distributed data processing, scalable design, and production-ready Spark job patterns. Whether you’re learning Spark or building real-world data pipelines, this repository serves as a solid reference for PySpark at scale.
